# qified
Task and Message Queues with Multiple Providers

> NOTE: This is a work in progress and not ready for production use. Please wait till v1.0.0 is released.

This is a mono repo that contains the following packages:
* [qified](packages/qified/README.md) - The main package that contains the core functionality and a built in in-memory provider.

There will be more packages added in the future such as:
* [@qified/redis](packages/redis/README.md) - Redis Provider
* [@qified/rabbitmq](packages/rabbitmq/README.md) - RabbitMQ Provider

# Development and Testing

Qified is written in TypeScript and tests are written in `vitest`. To run the tests, use the following command:

1. `nvm use` - This will use the correct node version
2. `pnpm install` - This will install all the dependencies
3. `pnpm test:services:start` - This will start the services needed for testing (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc)
4. `pnpm test` - This will run the tests
